# Fashion-Products-Classification

In this project, I will predict the type of fashion products by using Convolutional Neural Network architecture.

Fashion-MNIST is a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

Fashion products:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot
